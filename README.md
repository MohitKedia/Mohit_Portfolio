# [Project 5 : Levers-Vs-Indicators-Analysis](https://github.com/MohitKedia/Levers-Vs-Indicators-Analysis)

**Step 1 : The Problem statement for this project is to understand the factors or levers that impact session rating and session completion rate in live online interactive sessions**

*Step 2 : After knowing the problem statement, I had coordinated with Business or Content Team to understand key metrics or X variables that can impact the Y variables. Some of the x metrics are attendance%,#avg chat per user, #doubts asked, #quizzes asked,%quiz accuracy, %quiz attempt, %students who rated class slides as great, %doubts resolved and some of the y metrics are session rating, session completion rate and like dislike ratio.*

**Step 3 : After getting all metrics, I did data extraction by writing complex SQL queries using Window functions, CTEs, Joins and subqueries on Metabase and Amazon Redshift for which I coordinated with Multiple teams including Tech, Analytics and Product**

*Step 4 : After extracting the data, I performed data visualization and interactive dashboard to get hidden trends or insights*

**Step 5 : After getting insights, I had recommended few solutions to the business team,Content and Product Team to make few changes and we were able to improve session completion rate by 30%**
